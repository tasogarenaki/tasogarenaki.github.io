# 1 Fundations

- Set the course code

  1. Create a repository from GitHub

  2. Create a folder `A` on local 

  3. ```consoleÂ 
     $ cd A
     $ git clone https://github.com/my_repository.git
     $ cd B (Folder inside A)
     $ git remote add skeleton https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B/skeleton-sp18.git
     $ git pull skeleton master
     ```

  4. Move the `HelloWorld.java` and `HelloNumbers.java` that you previously created into the `lab1`directory.

  5. ```
     $ git add lab1/*
     $ git commit -m "completed first part of lab1"
     $ git push origin master
     ```

- Some key syntactic features:

  - `public class`: all code lives inside of classes.

  - The code that is run is inside of a method called `main`, which is declared as `public static void main(String[] args)`.
  - Use `{` and `}` to denote the beginning and the end of a section of code.
  - Statements must end with semi-colons `;`.
  - Comments with `/* */` or `//`.
  - Javadoc: `/** */` for methods or classes.
  - Compiler and Run Java program via Terminal:

  ```
  $ javac name.java
  $ java name
  ```

  - `static` type for all variables and expressions

    - Variables must be declared before it is used, and must have a specific type and the type can never change.
      - Let the programmer know exactly what sort of objekt is working with
      - No type erros

    ```java
    int x = 0;
    
    string x = "test";  // error
    ```

  - `System.out.print` will not print a newline (return), `System.out.println` will print a newline.

  - Functions:

    - Functions must be declared as part of a class. A function that is part of a class is method, so all functions are methods.
    - To define a function use `public static` (e.g. Python `def`).
    - All parameters of a functions must be declared.

    ```java
    public class LargerDemo {
        /** Returns the larger of x and y. */
        public static int larger(int x, int y) {
            if (x > y) {
                return x;
            }
            return y;
        }
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println(larger(8, 10));
        }
    }
    ```
