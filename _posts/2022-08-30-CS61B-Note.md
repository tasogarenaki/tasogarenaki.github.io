# 1 Introduction

- Set the course code

  1. Create a repository from GitHub

  2. Create a folder `A` on local 

  3. ```consoleÂ 
     $ cd A
     $ git clone https://github.com/my_repository.git
     $ cd B (Folder inside A)
     $ git remote add skeleton https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B/skeleton-sp18.git
     $ git pull skeleton master
     ```

  4. Move the `HelloWorld.java` and `HelloNumbers.java` that you previously created into the `lab1`directory.

  5. ```
     $ git add lab1/*
     $ git commit -m "completed first part of lab1"
     $ git push origin master
     ```

- Some key syntactic features:

  - `public class`: all code lives inside of classes.

  - The code that is run is inside of a method called `main`, which is declared as `public static void main(String[] args)`.

    - `void`: It has no return type.
    - `main`: This is the name of the method.
    - `String[] args`: This is a parameter that is passed to the main method.

  - Use `{` and `}` to denote the beginning and the end of a section of code.
  - Statements must end with semi-colons `;`.
  - Comments with `/* */` or `//`.
  - Javadoc: `/** */` for methods or classes.
  - Compiler and Run Java program via Terminal:

    ```
      $ javac name.java
      $ java name
    ```

  - `static` type for all variables and expressions

    - Variables must be declared before it is used, and must have a specific type and the type can never change.
        - Let the programmer know exactly what sort of objekt is working with
        - No type erros

    ```java
      int x = 0;
      
      string x = "test";  // error
    ```

  - `System.out.print` will not print a newline (return), `System.out.println` will print a newline.

  <br>

- Functions:

  - Functions must be declared as part of a class. A function that is part of a class is method, so all functions are methods.
    - To define a function use `public static` (e.g. Python `def`).
    - All parameters of a functions must be declared.

  ```java
    public class LargerDemo {
        /** Returns the larger of x and y. */
        public static int larger(int x, int y) {
            if (x > y) {
                return x;
            }
            return y;
        }
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println(larger(8, 10));
        }
    }
  ```

- Class

  - Examle:

    ```java
    /* Dog.java */
    public class Dog {		// non-static
        public int weightInPounds;		// instance variable 
        
        /* One integer constructor for dogs */
        public Dog(int w) {		// e.g. python def __init__
            weightInPounds = w;
        }
        
        public void makeNoise() {		// non-static method 
            if (weightInPounds < 10) {
                System.out.println("yip!");
            } else if (weightInPounds < 30) {
                System.out.println("bark");
            } else {
                System.out.println("wooof!");
            }
        }
    }
    
    /* DogLauncher.java */
    public class DogLauncher {		  // client of Dog class
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Dog d = new Dog();			// Declaration a new variable of type Dog
            d.weightInPounds = 51;	// Instantiation
            d.makeNoise();				 // Invocation
        }
    }
    
    > javac Dog.java
    > javac DogLauncher.java
    > java DogLauncher
    wooof!
    ```

    - A class that uses another class is sometimes called a "client" of that class, i.e. `DogLauncher` is a client of `Dog`. 
    - Instance variables or non-static variables must be declared inside the class. 
    - The `makeNoise()` is a **non-static / instance** method, and do not have the `static` keyword. If the method is going to be invoked by an instance of the class, then it should be non-static. It means, if one method needs to use the instance variable, the method must be non-static.
      - To call the `makeNoise` method should using the `new` keyword to instantiate a `Dog`, then call `d.makeNoise()`.
    - The constructor with signature `public Dog(int w)` will be invoked anytime that we try to create a `Dog` using the `new` keyword and a single integer parameter. Similar to Python `__init__` method.
    

  - **Non-static** Methods are actions that can be taken only by a specific instance of a class. 

    ```java
    Math m = new Math();
    x = m.sqrt(100);
    ```

  - **Static** methods are actions that are taken by the class itself.

    ```java
    x = Math.sqrt(100);
    ```

  - Static and non-static:

    ```java
    public Dog maxDog(Dog d2) {	 // non-static method
        if (this.weightInPounds > d2.weightInPounds) {
            return this;	// use the keyword this to refer to the current object
        }
        return d2;
    }
    
    /* invoke */
    Dog d = new Dog(15);	
    Dog d2 = new Dog(100);
    d.maxDog(d2);
    ```

  - Static Variables 

    ```java
    public class Dog {
        public int weightInPounds;
        public static String binomen = "Canis familiaris";	// static variable
        ...
    }
    
    /* invoke */
    Dog.binomen
    ```

  <br>

- Arrays of objects

  - use `new` keyword to create the array
  - use `new` again for each object that needs to put in the array

  ```java
  /* example 1 */
  Dog[] dogs = new Dog[2];		// Creates an array of Dogs of size 2
  dogs[0] = new Dog(8);			  // dog 1 has value of 8 
  dogs[1] = new Dog(20);
  dogs[0].makeNoise();			  // dog 1 invoke the method 
  
  /* example 2 */
  int[] name = new int[5];
  name[0] = 1;
  name[1] = 2; 
  ```
