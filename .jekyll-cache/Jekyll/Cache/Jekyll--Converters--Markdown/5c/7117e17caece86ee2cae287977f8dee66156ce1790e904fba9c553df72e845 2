<center>The idiom "虚室生白" comes from the book "The Renjianshi Of Zhuangzi". The literal translation is "to clear the mess out of the room, so that the sunlight can pour in and the room can be bright". This means that if a person is still and has no distracting thoughts in their mind, they will find the way and give birth to wisdom.</center>

<center>For me, life is a journey of learning and exploration. I hope this Chinese idiom will keep me grounded when I encounter obstacles throughout my journey.</center>
